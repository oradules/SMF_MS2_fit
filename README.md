# Code used to infer finite state Markov process models for transcription using MS2 and SMF data

## Content

- directory generate_models contains the code to generate objective functions needed for inference

    - To generate objective functions needed for 5 states models run in Matlab inverse_problem_symbolic5onemoviekini_mergep4p5ponkinishort.m
    - The output files resulting from this should be moved to fit_models directory (this is already done)
    - To generatate objective functions needed for 4 states models launch in Matlab inverse_problem_symbolic4onemovieponkini.m
    - The output files should be moved to fit_models directory (this is already done)

- directory fit_models contains the code for parameter model inference
    - To compute MS2 survival functions launch in Matlab Survival_function_short_long.m
    - To fit models launch in Matlab the following scripts
          fit_5expMODEL67_merge_onemoviekini_mergep4p5ponkinishort.m
          fit_5expMODEL45merge_onemoviekini_mergep4p5ponkinishort.m
          fit_5expMODEL23merge_onemoviekini_mergep4p5ponkinishort.m
          fit_5expMODEL17merge_onemoviekini_mergep4p5ponkinishort.m
          fit_5expMODEL14merge_onemoviekini_mergep4p5ponkinishort.m
          fit_5expMODEL1merge_onemoviekini_mergep4p5ponkinishort.m
          fit_4expMODEL91516_merge_onemovieponkini.m
          fit_4expMODEL911_merge_onemovieponkini.m
          fit_4expMODEL12_merge_onemovieponkini.m
  - To read results and generate figures launch in Matlab read_distribution_parsmerge_onemoviekini_mergep4p5ponkinishort.m
 The results are written in the directory results_mergekinimergep4p5ponkiniallshort45 (already done)
